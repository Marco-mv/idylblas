Pure Java BLAS Implementation by Idylwood Technologies

IdylBLAS is a fast, portable, numerically precise pure 100% Java BLAS implementation. It is intended to provide native-like linear algebra performance on the JVM which produces output which is architecture independent.

Having a fast, portable, numerically precise BLAS implementation on the JVM is important for several reasons
  1) Users do not have to download or compile architecture specific, native code
  2) Performing large array / matrix calculations does not incur the cost of leaving the JVM (in particular with JNI code the data will usually have to be copied outside the JVM)
  3) Developers are free to utilize the faster development time which comes with JVM languages and thus can optimize the programmer / code productivity tradeoff.
  4) Computations can be carried out on different architectures without worrying about incompatibility of results.

IdylBLAS is intended to be a drop in replacement for other Java BLAS libraries such as the Colt, OpenGamma and jblas which it achieves by implementing the BLAS interfaces in those libraries.
